In the example below, we are configuring the control in **Button / Dialog mode** on a **Quick Create form**.
We're using the Account Name column (though it can be any **Single Line of Text** column). The label is hidden, and the Search Brreg control is added to that column.
In the configuration panel, we enable the **showViewMapButton** option and map the columns from the API to the desired columns in the Account table.

> [!NOTE]  
> This control can be used on any table, we're just using `Account` for demo purposes.
